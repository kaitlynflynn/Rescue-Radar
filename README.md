# Rescue-Radar
Database that allows users to register/login to find animals around their current vicinity that need to be adopted and/or rehomed immediately. Appeal to this is that a lot of existing databases that are available today are centered specifically around shelters, rescue groups and/or breeders.  

Rescue groups also tend to be full majority of the time which leaves people no choice but to relinquish their pets to local shelters or worse, abandoning them all together. It would be nice to have a database that offers users an opportunity to network with other animal lovers locally in the event they ever need to rehome their current pet (due to life changing circumstances such as an owner becoming too ill and can no longer care for their animal etc). 

Site would allow users to filter available animals by type (cat/dog, etc) age, breed, and attributes such as good with other animals, good with kids, needs special medical attention etc. This site could pull data in from local animal shelters websites to show what is available for adoption as well given a lot of the animals in shelters are on a strict timeline to be adopted to their new forever homes.
